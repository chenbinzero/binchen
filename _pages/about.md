I am a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University. I received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Arizona State University, focusing on understanding defects in 2D materials. Before joining Northwestern, I completed postdoctoral training at the University of Toronto, where I studied perovskites, quantum dots, and their optoelectronic devices. Currently, my research centers on defect passivation and enhancing the stability of interfaces in perovskite solar cells.
